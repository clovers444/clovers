		<h3> Después de las Carreras </h3>
		<p> The Latin American modernist literary movement commenced around 1880 and ended three decades later. Due to literary waves being slow to reach Spanish-speaking shores, romanticism, realism, naturalism, and modernism all met and mingled when their blue Western waters became white foam, and their culmination came years after the West’s. Latin American modernism melds parnassianism and symbolism, it rejects the ordinary reality of day-to-day life, along with romantic sentimentality, realist solemnity, and naturalist science, and praises the sensitive artist oppressed by the bourgeoisie. It’s cosmopolitan, being helped by other languages in the creation of neologisms, it alternates between melancholy and effervescence, it manufactures perfect artificial images, and abuses alliteration and synesthesia. </p>
		<p><a href="translations.html"><i>Después de las Carreras</i></a>, published in <i>Cuentos frágiles (1883)</i> belongs to the first phase of modernism, it’s an incredibly structurally sound story that skillfully amalgamates the romantic with the modern. The juxtaposition of Berta—a beauty! a bourgeois! —and Manon, her seamstress, establishes the ideal atmosphere for synesthetic similes and metaphors, refined prosopopoeia, and onomatopoeic playfulness; subtle eroticism is ever-present, only adding to the carefully selected language, and heightening the splendor. Materials and their coldness astutely parade through the story, accentuating the criticism given to bourgeois lifestyles. The Goblins and genie guiding the speaker provide the correct amount of fantasy and dissociation, and further cement the already very modern as modern. Four delicate Parnassian stanzas serving as a bridge decorate the middle of the story, though far from being or trying to be technically perfect; depicting not the thing but the effect it produces enter the descriptions, hand in hand with connections.</p>
		<p>“Arriba, un cielo azul, de raso nuevo; mucha luz, y las notas de los pájaros subiendo, como almas de cristal” is a beautiful fragment, especially because the elegantly simple “mucha luz” is used to free from the deep sea of opulence and language Nájera has immersed the reader in, it re-appears at the end of the paragraph: “Mucha luz, muchas flores y un traje de seda nuevo: ¡ésa es la vida!” serving a similar purpose, and adding substructure to the text. Breaths, bare skin; marble, glass, porcelain, mirrors, sperm candles, flowers, flooring, satin, velvet, and silk, all threaded, all building, all participating in the production of crisp imagery, all comparing, creating distinctions and parallels between the two girls. Berta has a marble table, Manon has a marble arm; Berta is in the dark, Manon’s candle was lit; Berta is a blue lily, Manon is a sick lily; Berta has trouble falling asleep, Manon is already dreaming, the final thoughts of both are Caracole and lovers, but in such fundamentally different ways. “Todas las cosas tienen su lado luminoso y su lado sombrío.”, handcrafted duality, constructed and guided by the artisan to its climax.</p>
		<p>Bells chime, pianos complain in B-flat, clocks tick and tock, birds, and their rising notes. Scarce onomatopoeia, its appearance appreciated, nonetheless. I can’t help but feel there are hidden elements I’ve missed because of my absolute musical ignorance.</p>
		<p> The natural verbing of <i>travesura</i> (travesear) and <i>pavesa</i> (pavesear) makes the reader question if they weren’t verbs in the first place. Chantilly, Paris; Caracole, Aigle; and “sport”; the mentioning of locations in France, naming the horses with French words, very in-line with Nájera’s influences and environment, and that anglicism, all so fitting. “El retorcido caracol por donde se subía a las azoteas” indicating a spiral staircase, <i>escalera de caracol</i>, and the meaning of caracole, a pretty detail adding depth. The verb <i>pender</i> in “ese brazo desnudo que con el frío impudor del mármol, pendía” alluding oh-so discreetly to the pendulum in “la péndola incansable, enamorada eternamente de las horas.”, and the charmingly attached personification of the clock. Utilization of <i>rapazuelos</i>, meaning birds of prey and young men, with a derogatory suffix, to describe deceptive male beggars, making one think of Aigle anew, and their nightly sporting of “pheasant feathers” forms a clever pair. His love for words is so apparent one can’t help but love them as well. </p>
		<p> The plot may be unoriginal and overused, but this story is anything but unimportant. Not only does it beautifully represent a period, a movement, it also shows talent, a great understanding of aesthetics and language, and skill cultivated through decades of writing. </p>
