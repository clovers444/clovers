		<h3> august 21, 2021 </h3>
		<p>rain unfolds, and folds intermittently; the folding is less noticeable than the unfolding. every drop like a transparent sheet of paper, like a foldable sheet of the thinnest glass, some sheets with rounded edges, some ovals, some circles. how feminine. thinking of angles as masculine isn't organic to me, but i was told i should think this way, was told everyone does. drops are angular when falling, and softly curved when fallen, but if i were to see them fall slowly, fall gently, fall passively, i'd feel like their state of non-angularity is unwavering.</p> 
		<p>it drizzles at 5 am, rains at 6, and continues throughout 7, i lost consciousness while in seven's fractions, probably between fractions 4o and 50, so i'll assume it mizzled at 9. awake at 12, asleep again, awake at 1, asleep again, officially awake at 3:06 pm. </p>
		<p>though awake at sunrise, the desire to see our throneless chrysanthemum bloom arrived an hour late. the glass, fingers before and after doigt√©; cold and wet.  my forehead forced into submission being pressed against the glass, i look out the window for a few minutes before wondering what i'm looking at. what am i looking at? light. light!</p>
		<p>the sun bloomed, the rain makes it look as if it hadn't. </p>
		<p> annotations. you liked that too, didn't you? previous person and i are getting indelicate.</p>

		<h3> august 20, 2021 </h3>
		<p> rainy day women #12 & 35 plays in the background of an afternoon, barely after noon, breakfast, which could only happen because of an 11:35 am alarm. </p>
		<p>interrupted, </p>
		<p> interrupted by the urge to pull out my hair and the adequate subsequent action, the reaction. so i fell to my knees in the kitchen and publicly reacted privately, like people in the supermarket and their private public pacing. truthfully, i was interrupted by the urge's cause, then by the urge itself, then by the reaction, and then i was no longer interrupted, amid an interruption no longer was i. </p>
		<p> you jokingly tell me to listen to music for people my age, but it was him and you, you and him, who thought i'd like it and wanted me to listen, i let you know. i think you respond by telling me that a lot of my music sounds similar, that's why you recommended it, i reply with "it's true. it's true.", and it ends. </p>
		<p> if i could write like you, would i? unlikely, it goes against the not so recently turned banal concept of nature. but sometimes i doubt even that, nature. </p>
		<p> you, another you, tell me i should sell something, it's all about profit, all about a service, a product. from something somewhere originated the idea that i have something to offer. i don't. even if i did, my nonexistent product would take time to produce, i'm extremely slow, in all senses, and no one would be willing to wait. </p>
		<p> i have nothing to sell, only myself. what if i sold myself to you, another you? would you purchase? </p>
		<p> whoever put me in charge of this business is less business-minded than i. </p>
