		<h3> september 26, 2021 </h3>
		<p>looking for words is useless when none are hidden for you to find. </p>
		<p>what a terrible way of expressing the way i feel, so absolutely lackluster, not at all different to the everything i'm stuck contemplating.</p>
		<p>in the hopes of meaning and wholeness, i find myself becoming emptier. i am consumed by other pointless searches that also guarantee dissatisfaction; consumed by my inability to be; consumed by an uncomfortable, inexorable, oppressive monotony; consumed by time, forever my antagonist, always running or resting at precisely the moment i need it to do the opposite.</p>
		<p> i have nothing to say, i should convince myself completely of this. of course, denying life and its participants comment would mean inutility and inaction which would lead to a much more real conscious death. what would this death mean? unsure, but i'm sure i don't want to find out. </p>
		<p>supermarkets feel like highways, particularly when planning unconsciousness in a state of confused hopefulness. i'm always in this state in some way, but this way of being in it becomes differentiable when the confusion escalates and hopefulness deescalates. i like to think i'm disconnected from what this place has offered me and what it'll offer, i'm not. i am as connected to everything around me as my mind allows, which is both positive and negative, but i am connected. i can admit, accept and appreciate this connection from time to time, more often now than before. i don't want to die physically and live mentally. i'm scared. </p>
		<p>i hate the lights, i hate the feeling, i hate people, i hate myself. but the coinciding variables create a perfect bubble where i feel real and human and warm.</p>
		<p>i am. if it isn't for you, it's for me. if it isn't for me, it's for you.</p>

		<h3> september 1, 2021 </h3>
		<p> my face looks particularly wrong today, like a layered, colored candle melting into a puddle; like if i'd been made from the hardened pieces of that candle's wax. every piece of me clumsily placed and incorrectly colored. on days like these, i can't stop looking at myself, i'm looking for some sign of beauty that never shows. vanity, all i can give myself. vain, all i can recognize myself as.</p>
		<p> looking at oneself is too pretty a pleasure and too great a torture. </p>
		<p> everything enjoyable must be equally distressing. </p>
		<p> daffodils; but it is no longer spring, i should move on to a lesser flower. </p>
		<p>all seasons are equally distressing but i forget soon after they pass. i live in and detest, i long for and adore, the moment.</p>
		<p>i begin to doubt fullness, but i'm in no position to doubt. i'm empty in a truly shameful way, empty in the sense that no indication of true being can be found within me. i am, but i am not, i should not be; i am because i modify, i am not and should not be because none of my modifications are of value. if they were, would i want to change what i so deeply detest? only if i deeply appreciated it. i will accept this contradiction as i have many before. i am wrong. </p>
