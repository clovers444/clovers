		<h3> august 20, 2021 </h3>
		<p> rainy day women #12 & 35 plays in the background of an afternoon, barely after noon, breakfast, which could only happen because of an 11:35 am alarm. </p>
		<p>interrupted, </p>
		<p> interrupted by the urge to pull out my hair and the adequate subsequent action, the reaction. so i fell to my knees in the kitchen and publicly reacted privately, like people in the supermarket and their private public pacing. truthfully, i was interrupted by the urge's cause, later by the urge itself, later by the reaction, and then i was no longer interrupted, amid an interruption no longer was i. </p>
		<p> you jokingly tell me to listen to music for people my age, but it was him and you, you and him, who thought i'd like it and wanted me to listen, i let you know. i think you respond by telling me that a lot of my music sounds similar, that's why you recommended it, i reply with "it's true. it's true.", and it ends. </p>
		<p> if i could write like you, would i? unlikely, it goes against the not so recently turned banal concept of nature. but sometimes i doubt even that, nature. </p>
		<p> you, another you, tell me i should sell something, it's all about profit, all about a service, a product. from something somewhere originated the idea that i have something to offer. i don't. even if i did, my nonexistent product would take time to produce, i'm extremely slow, in all senses, and no one would be willing to wait. </p>
		<p> i have nothing to sell, only myself. what if i sold myself to you, another you? would you purchase? </p>
		<p> whoever put me in charge of this business is less business-minded than i. </p>
