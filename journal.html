		<h3> september 1, 2021 </h3>
		<p> my face looks particularly wrong today, like a layered, colored candle melting into a puddle; like if i'd been made from the hardened pieces of that candle's wax. every piece of me clumsily placed and incorrectly colored. on days like these, i can't stop looking at myself, i'm looking for some sign of beauty that never shows. vanity, all i can give myself. vain, all i can recognize myself as.</p>
		<p> looking at oneself is too pretty a pleasure and too great a torture. </p>
		<p> everything enjoyable must be equally distressing. </p>
		<p> daffodils; but it is no longer spring i should move on to a lesser flower. </p>
		<p>all seasons are equally distressing but i forget soon after they pass. i live in and detest, i long for and adore the moment.</p>
		<p>i begin to doubt fullness, but i'm in no position to doubt. i'm empty in a truly shameful way, empty in the sense that no indication of true being found within me. i am, but i am not, i should not be; i am because i modify, i am not and should not be because none of my modifications are of value. if they were, would i want to change what i so deeply detest? only if i deeply appreciate it. i will accept this contradiction as i have many before. i am wrong. </p>
